## Scalability Assessment

![Scalability Roadmap](chart-scalability-roadmap)

### 1. Horizontal Scaling Potential
```javascript
Current Architecture Scalability:
✅ Stateless API design - Easy to scale
✅ Database connection pooling - Supports scaling
✅ JWT authentication - No session storage needed
⚠️ Single database instance - Potential bottleneck
⚠️ File uploads - Would need CDN for scale

Scaling Recommendations:
1. Implement database read replicas
2. Add Redis for session/cache management
3. Use CDN for image storage (Cloudinary scaling)
4. Container orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes)
```

### 2. Vertical Scaling Analysis
| Resource | Current | 2x Load | 5x Load | 10x Load |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| CPU | 25% avg | 50% avg | 80% avg | Need upgrade |
| Memory | 120MB | 240MB | 600MB | Need upgrade |
| Database | Light | Medium | Heavy | Need sharding |
| Storage | 500MB | 1GB | 2.5GB | Acceptable |

### 3. Performance Projections
```javascript
User Growth Projections:
Current Capacity: ~100 concurrent users

Projected Performance at Scale:
- 500 users:   Need database optimization
- 1,000 users: Need horizontal scaling  
- 5,000 users: Need microservices architecture
- 10,000+ users: Need complete infrastructure redesign

Recommended Scaling Timeline:
Phase 1 (0-500 users):   Database optimization
Phase 2 (500-2K users):  Add caching layer
Phase 3 (2K-10K users):  Horizontal scaling
